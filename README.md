# Employee Tracker

## Introduction 
For this project we needed to create an employee tracker app using inquirer, mysql2, and console.table. We created a database from scratch so users can keep track of their employees, departments, and roles using a command line application.

## Installation
Users will need to download the packages by running the command 'npm i' in order to use this program. They need to run mysql and download the .sql docs by typing 'mysql -u root -p' and entering their sequel password. Once that is entered they can run the command 'SOURCE db/schema.sql' to create the db tables  then 'SOURCE db/seeds.sql' to fill in the tables. Once the download is complete they need to type 'node server.js' in order to begin the app. By following the prompts the users will be able to see the information. By hitting 'cmd C' users can exit the program.
