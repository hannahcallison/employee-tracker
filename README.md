# Employee Tracker

## Introduction 
For this project we needed to create an employee tracker app using inquirer, mysql2, and console.table. We created a database from scratch so users can keep track of their employees, departments, and roles.

## Installation
Users will need to download the packages by running the command 'npm i' in order to use this program. Once the download is complete they need to type 'node server.js' in order to begin the app.
